## 🧠 Project Title & Problem Statement

**TeamFuse** is a productivity and collaboration platform that helps student and developer teams track progress, manage tasks, and visualize contributions effectively.  
It addresses the problem of **limited visibility into individual engagement**, **communication gaps**, and **unbalanced workloads** within group projects.  

The platform enables:
- Real-time project updates and activity tracking  
- Task assignment with performance scoring  
- GitHub and Google Docs integration  
- Visual dashboards for contribution analytics  

By combining these, TeamFuse ensures **transparent, data-driven teamwork** and improved project outcomes.

## Folder Structure & Explanation

```bash
src/
├── app/          # Application routes and pages using Next.js App Router
├── components/   # Reusable UI elements like buttons, cards, and modals
├── lib/          # Utility functions, configurations, and helper logic
├── styles/       # Global styles and Tailwind configuration
├── public/       # Static assets (images, icons, and logos)
````

### Description:

* **app/** → Defines routes and page layouts for better navigation.
* **components/** → Promotes reusability and clean, consistent UI design.
* **lib/** → Contains shared logic, configurations, and API helpers.
* **styles/** → Stores Tailwind and global styling files for theme control.
* **public/** → Holds static assets accessible throughout the app.

This modular structure helps maintain **clarity**, **scalability**, and **team collaboration** throughout the development cycle.
